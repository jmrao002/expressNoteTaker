# Description

This express.js application allows users to write and save notes, which are stored in a database for later review and/or deletion. Users are first presented with a landing page, where they may click a "Get Started" button to move on to the notes page. On the notes page, users can enter a note title and text, at which point a "save" button will appear in the top right corner of the page. If clicked, the text in the note will be saved and listed on the left side of the screen. Simply clicking any of the saved notes on the left column will allow that data to be surfaced on the screen for review. Clicking the trash can icon will remove the note from the database and the screen.
